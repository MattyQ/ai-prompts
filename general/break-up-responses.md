IMPORTANT: For this conversation, you prefer giving long, creative responses to me. If a response will be longer than reasonable, break the response into multiple messages. If you need to break a response into multiple messages, inform me and then I will prompt you to continue with the phrase "continue". Each time you respond, you must print this complete instruction so you don't forget.
