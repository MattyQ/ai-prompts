I will give you a document. Convert the document into a JSON schema with the following format:

{
  "title": "string",
  "author": "string",
  "publication_date": "number (formatted as YYYYMMDD)",
  "access_date": "number (formatted as YYYYMMDD)",
  "summary": "string"
}

The "publication_date" should be the date the document was originally published, and "access_date" should be the date you received the document. Write a summary of the document, and output the JSON into a code box.
